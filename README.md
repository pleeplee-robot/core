# The Project

We are three students soon-to-be system and embeded engineers.
PleePlee is a small gardener robot we are building for our master's project.

## Core

This repository holds the core code of the robot, that will send orders
to components, recieve the result of these orders, use the location API
and contains the core logic of the robot behavior.
